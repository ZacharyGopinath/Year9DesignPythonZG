#how to print lots of times without lots ot print functions
#A loop  structure, such as for loop, can represet patterns such as print over and over
#1 = count, 6 = check, 1 = change

for i in range(1, 1000000000000000, 1):
	print("Your mark is", i, "%")

#^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Loop code block, this one looks at whether i
#loop runs over and over until it isn't true any more
#var "i" is the counting variable, it can be anything, can be replaced, eg. j
